**Description:** Vitale Morov has bought a number of cursed and haunted paintings and is going to use them as a centerpiece of his new art gallery, the Fantasia Art Exhibition. After showing off the art he plans to sell them to any interested parties, hopefully before anyone realizes the artworks true nature. **Possible Complications**: Some of the Paintings are cursed portals, leading to a monster's den. Others are haunted by vengeful spirits. Any of these could be suddenly released to cause havoc. However if someone buys one, they may find later on that bad luck or great misfortune is now following them.

**Resources Spent**: 2 Treasury, 1 Rresource ([[Rosaline Briar]])

**Result**: Moderate Success, No reward. 
**Description**: The initial opening of the Art Gallery is a success, but the first major buyer of the artwork is soon brutally murdered by the very pieces he bought. Vitale is forced to close down the Gallery for 'Renovations' temporarily while he tries to cover up the galleries connection to the art dealers death. 

**Possible Plot Hook:** An art dealer by the name of Harris Lupton was recently found murdered in his own home. Shortly afterwards the maids began to quit, apparently in fear that the building was now haunted. The authorities have made no progress in the investigation and have been forced to board up the abandoned building for the time being.
