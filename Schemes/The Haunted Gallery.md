**Description:** Vitale Morov has bought a number of cursed and haunted paintings and is going to use them as a centerpiece of his new art gallery, the Fantasia Art Exhibition. After showing off the art he plans to sell them to any interested parties, hopefully before anyone realizes the artworks true nature. **Possible Complications**: Some of the Paintings are cursed portals, leading to a monster's den. Others are haunted by vengeful spirits. Any of these could be suddenly released to cause havoc. However if someone buys one, they may find later on that bad luck or great misfortune is now following them.

**Resources Spent**: 2 Treasury (edited)
