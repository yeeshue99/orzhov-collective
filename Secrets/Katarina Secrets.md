- Katarina is a Changeling, who presents as Human. She keeps this knowledge as close to the chest as possible. As such, she can imitate anyone. She has a couple of other changelings in her employ to help facilitate her schemes when they require an airtight case. (Known to no one at the moment)
- _Ronan Steelvale_ is one of the personas that Katarina and her employed Changelings sometimes leverage. This persona is one of the "cleaner" personas, that's not connected to the Orzhov as strongly. (Known to no one at the moment)
