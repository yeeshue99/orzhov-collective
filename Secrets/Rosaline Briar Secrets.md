- Her real name is Brianna Huxley, and she was once her predecessor’s most brutal enforcer. While she now seems almost pacifist, there’s no doubt that she could dip back into her old tactics. (Only known by [[Katarina Carminova]] and [[Qadir]])
- The Rosaline Briar Soup Kitchen, despite claiming to be fully legal, actually is supported by robbery, blackmail, and shakedowns. (Secret to the public, but known by all [[_Council Members|Council Members]])
- No one knows exactly where Brianna got her magic powers from (powers that she gained not too long before she assumed her new identity as Rosaline), to the point where even she herself isn’t quite sure of the source. However, the main hypothesis is that she accidentally made some kind of pact with a being too vast to be aware of her existence. Neither the terms Sorcerer nor Warlock quite fit her, but it’s most likely that she’s draining power from the eldritch being like a battery.(Mystery known by all  [[_Council Members|Council Members]], timing only known by [[Katarina Carminova]], and main hypothesis only known by [[Vitale Morov]])
- Despite her seductive flair that she uses to get what she wants, Rosaline is Aromantic-Asexual. She enjoys a bit of “horizontal dancing” every now and then, but only as an activity that induces a druglike high; otherwise, she has no romantic or sexual attraction towards anyone.
