Abyzou was always a curious girl. She had vision, dedication, a drive to discover the mysteries of the world and leave a mark on it. Grad school didn’t dull that fire, but it did worsen her sleep schedule, which gradually deteriorated her mental state, which led to her getting desperate for a good thesis to write dissertations on post-graduation. She found it when she tested the balance between life and death, almost slipped past the barrier, and instead gained strength and companionship from the abyss (and the Sibriex that awaited her there).

Sent back with a mission, a new name, and a joint wonder of and disrespect for human life’s sanctity, Abyzou quickly joined the Orzhov Syndicate as their “Chief of Ingenuity” (as she calls it). If the Syndicate or their associates need new tech or chemicals, she’s there…so long as she can have the spare bodies when they’re done. She has so much work to do.
