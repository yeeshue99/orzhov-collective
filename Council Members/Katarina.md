Knowledge is power and Katarina lives & breathes this motto. She's quite adept at gathering and manipulating information. As such, she's learned just the right buttons to push to nudge others to do what she wants. She lives for the long-term machinations and seeing the dominoes ripple across the playing field. Only those she trusts absolutely know the secret to her success. Those in her employ specialize in stealth and undercover operations. She has a wide reaching network of informants, both willing and unwilling.
