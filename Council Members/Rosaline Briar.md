Everyone knows that “Rosaline Briar” isn’t her real name, but nobody knows who she was before she took on that moniker. Despite her hedonistic tendencies, Rosaline keeps a tight and efficient control over her department, keeping quality reliably good. One of the most aggravating things about her, however, is that she proclaims herself to be a “Hero of the People”, despite the fact that her very job description includes stepping on those she claims to be saving.
